TASK 6:
Prediction using decision tree algorithm.

I am implementing Decision Tree for Iris dataset.

This is one of the task as part of the internship curriculum.

Decision Trees are used to build a model which predicts the labels for each example.

Steps to be followed.

1. Download the ipython file and import the required softwares.

Building any ML model has the following similar sort of steps:
Import all the required libraries.
Collect the data and perform the EDA(Exploratory data analysis)to know about the dataset(s).
Do the feature-engineering processes to bring the data into proper and useful shape.
Create a model and pass the data.
Evaluate the models prediction using suitable matric(s).
